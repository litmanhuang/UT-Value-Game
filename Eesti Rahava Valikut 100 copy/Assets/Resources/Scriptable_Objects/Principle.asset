  title: 'Principles versus politeness '
  description: "Peter, who is an ecologist, is very troubled by the way animals and
    birds are being treated in contemporary mass-production of food. He believes
    that living in a cage is harassing and he \u201Cvotes with his wallet\u201D \u2013
    Peter only purchases eggs from free-range chickens or \u201Chappy chicken\u201D
    eggs. His friend James invites Peter to visit and James\u2019s wife has baked
    an amazing aromatic golden-yellow cake. When Peter asks about the eggs used,
    he finds out that they used regular store-bought eggs because James\u2019s family
    looks at the price tag more than anything else. Peter needs to decide whether
    to stay true to his principles or to be polite and have some cake. "
  question: "What would you do in Peter\u2019s position? "
  answer1: 'I will explain to James that I do not want to go against my beliefs and
    I will not eat the cake. (Hero) '
  answer2: "I would like to keep my good relationship with James and I will say,
    \u201COh, I just ate! I am sorry, I will skip the cake.\u201D (Trader) "
  answer3: 'I do not want to offend them; you have to honour the lady of the house.
    I will take as small a piece as possible. (Healer) '
  answer4: 'The cake is already baked and the egg-producer got their money anyway.
    There is no point in refusing now; I will thank my hosts and eat the cake. (Ruler) '
