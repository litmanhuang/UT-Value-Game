  title: "Frog\u2019s dilemma "
  description: 'An evil witch turns the first-born son of a king into a frog. He
    can become human again only when a highborn princess kisses him, and then he
    must marry the princess. Luckily, the crown princess from the neighbouring kingdom
    has agreed to kiss the prince. The problem is that the princess has a very bad
    temper, is selfish and does not care about her people. The prince is not keen
    on the idea of marrying her. The princess has managed to scare away every possible
    suitor so far. '
  question: 'What would you do as the frog prince? '
  answer1: 'I will offer her a bartering deal: she will turn me into a prince and
    let me go free, and in return, I will give her half of my kingdom once I inherit
    it. (Trader) '
  answer2: 'I want to become human again. If the price to be paid is a life with
    the princess, so be it. I am willing to suffer for it. I will allow the princess
    to kiss me and I try to have a good relationship with her. I believe in the power
    of love! (Healer) '
  answer3: 'I would never let her kiss me! It is likely there are other princesses
    out there somewhere. I would rather be a frog than owe my life to someone who
    could easily make it a living hell. I will jump away. (Hero) '
  answer4: 'I will accept her kiss and become human again. Romance is overrated.
    If I marry her, I believe that everyone can benefit if we join our kingdoms and
    even the people living there. (Ruler). '
